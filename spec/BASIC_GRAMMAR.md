# üìè BASIC GRAMMAR

- Instructions can end with a semicolon, but it isn‚Äôt mandatory.
- Blocks of code (i.e.: functions, if blocks, etc.) are delimited by curly brackets, as is standard in many programming languages.
- When type annotations are used, it‚Äôs placed after the identifier: `identifier:type`.
- `//` indicates a single line comment and `/**/` indicates a multi-line comment.
