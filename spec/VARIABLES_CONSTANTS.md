# ðŸ”¢ VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS

`let` defines a variable, a value that might be changed later. i.e.: `let name = "Andrew"` or `let name = "Andrew"`. `const` defines a constant value. i.e.: `const name = "Andrew"` or `const name = "Andrew"`. Types will automatially be inferred.

One can also define a constant to hold a numeric value with `#def`. You donâ€™t need the assign symbol.
